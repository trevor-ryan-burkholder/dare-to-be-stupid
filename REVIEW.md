# Codex code review — 15 August 2026

> **Ownership:** This is the Codex reviewer document. Codex records and verifies findings here;
> Claude Code owns implementation. Do not treat an entry as closed until Codex has reviewed the
> repair and the relevant verification has passed.

**Reviewed tree:** `main` at `65a14cc` (`pre-codex`), version `0.161.0`
**Code continuity:** no executable script, hook, or template changed. Documentation releases
through 0.164.0 align the launcher, flag, configuration, workflow, and roadmap contracts with
existing behavior. The 0.164.0 launcher change is prose only; F1–F5 code remains byte-identical,
and finding status is authoritative only here.
**Verdict:** **CHANGES REQUESTED** — four high-priority safety defects and one medium-priority
timeout defect are open.

This remains a read-only review of the Claude-native implementation. The documentation cleanup
does not implement or close any finding.

## Open findings

### F1 — HIGH: acquire the repository lock atomically before any work

**Status:** OPEN
**Affected:** `scripts/driver.mjs:5337-5344`, `scripts/run-lock.mjs:64-79`

The driver claims `.meeseeks/lock.json` only after PRD authoring, design authoring, quality-plugin
provisioning, writes, and commits. Preflight checks the lock in a different process and does not
hold it while the driver starts. Two launches can therefore both pass preflight and operate on the
same repository before either reaches `claimRunLock`.

The final check and claim are also separate operations. `claimRunLock` writes a fixed temporary
file and renames it over the lock, intentionally replacing an existing lock. Two contenders that
both observe an absent lock can therefore both claim successfully, depending on scheduling.

**Impact:** This violates the one-driver-per-repository invariant. Concurrent drivers can reset,
write, and commit over each other, making both runs' evidence and results untrustworthy.

**Required resolution:**

- Acquire the lock in the driver before the first child spawn, repository write, install, or
  commit.
- Make acquisition one atomic filesystem operation, not `check` followed by overwrite. An
  exclusive create or atomic lock directory are suitable shapes.
- Preserve the documented stale-lock recovery, but make takeover an explicit retry after the
  stale owner has been established.
- Give each acquisition an ownership token and only let that owner clear it; an aborting loser
  must not remove the winner's lock.

**Acceptance evidence:**

- A real concurrency test starts two claimers against one directory and proves exactly one wins.
- A second live driver is refused before any child is spawned and before any tracked file changes.
- A dead owner's stale lock remains reclaimable.
- A process that did not acquire the lock cannot clear another process's lock.

### F2 — HIGH: driver-initiated termination does not bound a child that ignores SIGTERM

**Status:** OPEN
**Affected:** `scripts/driver.mjs:4396-4403`, `scripts/driver.mjs:4420-4431`,
`scripts/driver.mjs:4450-4464`, `scripts/driver.mjs:4487-4504`

When `timeoutMs` expires, `shell` sets `timedOut = true` and sends `SIGTERM`. It settles only after
the child emits `exit`. There is no grace timer, `SIGKILL` escalation, or independent settlement
path if the child traps or ignores `SIGTERM`.

The 64 MB output-cap path has the same defect. It sets `overflowed = true`, sends only `SIGTERM`,
and calls `finishOverflowed()` only after `exit`. The later timeout cannot rescue this path:
overflow owns the verdict, but neither branch can force or independently settle a resistant child.

The timeout reproduction below was executed. The overflow extension is established by the control
flow above; its resistant-child fixture remains required acceptance evidence rather than a claimed run.

**Verified reproduction:** A child that ignored `SIGTERM` and exited naturally after one second
was run with `timeoutMs: 100`. `shell` reported a timeout, but returned after **1,018 ms**. A child
that never exits would defeat the watchdog indefinitely.

**Impact:** Gate, deploy, and Claude-child ceilings plus output-limit termination are not hard
bounds. A process can still stall an unattended run forever despite the log promising it will be
killed after a stated time.

**Required resolution:**

- Send `SIGTERM` at the deadline, allow a short bounded grace period, then force termination with
  `SIGKILL` where supported.
- Apply the force step to the relevant process tree/group and retain the descendant sweep.
- Guarantee that the promise settles even if the direct child never emits a cooperative exit
  after `SIGTERM`.
- Apply the same bounded terminate/force/sweep mechanism when the output cap fires.
- Keep timeout, buffer overflow, and self-termination as distinct verdicts.

**Acceptance evidence:**

- Tier 2 starts a direct child that traps `SIGTERM` forever and proves `shell` returns within the
  deadline plus the documented grace period.
- The resistant child and its descendants are no longer alive after return.
- A child that exceeds the output cap and ignores `SIGTERM` also settles within the grace bound;
  its descendants are gone and its verdict remains overflow rather than timeout.
- Existing bystander, ordinary-overflow, ordinary-failure, and self-termination tests remain green.

### F3 — HIGH: the health gate can pass against an unrelated local service

**Status:** OPEN
**Affected:** `scripts/health-probe.mjs:149-165`, `scripts/health-probe.mjs:451-469`

`detectBoundPort` accepts the first `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `0.0.0.0` port printed by the
start command. `probeHealth` then replaces the assigned `PORT` with that number and treats a valid
response there as evidence that the spawned application is healthy. Printed output establishes no
ownership of the listener.

**Verified reproduction:** A decoy HTTP server was started locally. The health-probe child opened
no socket at all; it only printed the decoy's URL and stayed alive. `probeHealth` returned:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "detail": "health endpoint answered 200 (... announced by the application; PORT=... was set but not honored)"
}
```

**Impact:** A stale development server, dependency, proxy, or deliberately printed URL can satisfy
the observability gate while the application under test never starts. This is a false pass in a
required ship gate and violates the nothing-defaults-to-pass invariant.

**Required resolution:**

- Do not treat stdout alone as proof that the spawned process owns a listener.
- The simplest fail-closed policy is to require the assigned `PORT`. If announced-port fallback
  remains, it needs independent ownership evidence tying the listener to the spawned process tree,
  or an explicit driver/operator-owned port contract.
- Re-check child state before accepting a successful response so a startup failure cannot race a
  stale listener into a pass.
- Preserve the useful mismatch diagnosis; the defect is promoting the hint to passing evidence.

**Acceptance evidence:**

- The decoy reproduction fails even though the printed URL answers correctly.
- A real application that owns the accepted listener still passes under the chosen contract.
- A child that exits or fails to bind cannot pass through a pre-existing listener on the same
  port.

### F4 — MEDIUM: streaming HTTP responses bypass the health deadline

**Status:** OPEN
**Affected:** `scripts/health-probe.mjs:86-109`, `scripts/health-probe.mjs:270-299`

Both request helpers resolve a successful response only on `response.end`. The request timeout is
Node's socket-inactivity timeout, not a wall-clock deadline. A server that keeps writing bytes but
never ends the response is never inactive, so the request promise never resolves and the outer
probe loop cannot check its deadline. Response `aborted` and premature `close` are also not handled.

**Verified reproduction:** A health endpoint sent `200`, wrote a byte every 50 ms, and never ended.
The configured probe deadline was not enforced; when the fixture later terminated, Node reported
an unsettled top-level await instead of a normal probe result. If the server remains alive, the
outer gate watchdog is the next bound — `gateTimeoutMs` defaults to **2,700,000 ms (45 minutes)**.

**Impact:** A nominal 30-second health or smoke check can stall an unattended iteration for up to
the much larger outer gate ceiling, or indefinitely when used without that outer ceiling.

**Required resolution:**

- Give each HTTP attempt an absolute wall-clock deadline based on the remaining probe time and
  destroy/abort the request when it expires.
- Handle response `aborted`, response `error`, and premature `close` as failed attempts.
- Cap the response body while receiving it rather than accumulating an unbounded stream and
  slicing only after `Buffer.concat`.
- Apply the same behavior to local health requests and remote smoke requests.

**Acceptance evidence:**

- A continuously streaming response fails within the configured deadline plus a small scheduling
  tolerance.
- A prematurely aborted response returns a normal failed result rather than leaving an unsettled
  promise.
- An oversized body is bounded during collection.
- Ordinary local health and remote smoke responses still pass.

### F5 — HIGH: ambient operator credentials cross into every Claude role

**Status:** OPEN
**Affected:** `scripts/driver.mjs:1273-1295`, `scripts/driver.mjs:4705-4717`,
`scripts/driver.mjs:4867-4869`

`main` uses `io.env ?? process.env` as the run environment. `childEnvironment` copies that entire
record with `{ ...env }`, adding only the Meeseeks markers, and `spawnClaude` hands the result to
every `claude -p` phase. Builder, Panel, Oracle-author, architect, lesson-extractor, and other
roles therefore inherit unrelated operator credentials and secrets without an explicit grant.

**Impact:** An unattended Builder can inspect ambient tokens directly from its shell, and hostile
repository instructions or prompt injection can induce their use or disclosure. Cold roles also
receive credentials unrelated to their assignment. The pre-production warning reduces expected
exposure but does not establish a trust boundary.

**Required resolution:**

- Execute PLAN item 56's paid synthetic-canary probe before choosing the allowlist; the Claude CLI,
  authentication, executable discovery, and platform environment are external contracts.
- Construct a minimal child environment plus an explicit operator-configured allowlist of additional
  variable names. Preserve every measured Meeseeks run/depth marker.
- Never persist or print environment values. A refusal or preflight diagnostic may name a variable
  but must not reveal its value.
- Apply the boundary to every Claude role and descendant without weakening authentication, ordinary
  target-tool discovery, guard propagation, or cold-role isolation.

**Acceptance evidence:**

- Unit tests prove synthetic secrets are absent, required benign neighbours and Meeseeks markers
  survive, and no value appears in diagnostics or driver-owned artifacts.
- A paid tier-3 test proves a real Claude child and its shell cannot observe the synthetic canary
  while authentication and normal target-tool discovery still work.
- The same probe covers Builder and at least one cold role; a role-specific exception requires an
  explicit operator allowlist entry rather than ambient inheritance.

## Verification performed

All existing non-paid gates were green after this documentation repair; the executable tree
remains byte-identical to the reviewed tree:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test` — **2,307 passed, 0 failed**
- `npm run test:integration` — **51 passed, 0 failed**
- `npm run release-check` — **ok** at `0.164.0`; no shipped file has changed since release and
  `HANDOFF.md` agrees

The paid live tier was not run. Existing green tests do not cover the four failure shapes above.

## Closure protocol

Claude Code may implement the repairs in any order that preserves `DESIGN.md` and the repository
invariants. After implementation, ask Codex to re-review the exact diff. Codex will change an item
to `CLOSED` only after tracing the repair and checking the stated acceptance evidence.
